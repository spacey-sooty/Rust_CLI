# Rust Command Line Interface 

## Installation 

To install this project you will need to download the latest release from the release section. This should download the bin folder. If your one Windows move the bin folder to your desired location then add it to your path variable. If you are on Linux just copy the contents of bin into your bin folder. Make sure to get the correct release for your platform. 

## MacOS Support 

I don't have any intention to provide MacOS support but if you would like to add MacOS support yourself feel free to.
